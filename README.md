# devhive (Stage 1 production of Devhive Messaging + Posting compatible)
## Problem Statement
Developers often face challenges in finding collaborators for their projects, sharing their
work, and seeking advice or feedback from the community. Existing platforms may not
provide a conducive environment for anonymous discussions, which could limit the
willingness of developers to openly share their ideas or seek help due to concerns about
intellectual property theft, criticism, or other personal reasons. Therefore, there is a need for
a dedicated platform that allows developers to engage in anonymous chats, post threads for
collaboration opportunities, share their work securely and interact with like-minded
individuals without the fear of judgment or privacy breaches.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
